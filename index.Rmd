## Bio

Mitchell Naylor is an applied machine learning professional with extensive experience in natural language processing (NLP), statistical modeling, and deep learning. Mitch currently works as a lead data scientist at Azra AI, where he develops, improves, and deploys clinical NLP models. Additionally, Mitch leads applied research efforts in areas including language modeling, transfer learning, robustness, and model fairness. In addition to his work at Azra AI, Mitch is an author of [Applied Causal Inference](https://appliedcausalinference.github.io/aci_book/), which released in August 2023.

Mitch lives in Chattanooga, TN. Outside of work, he enjoys rock climbing, hiking, music, and traveling.
