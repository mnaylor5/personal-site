## Bio

Mitchell Naylor is an applied machine learning professional with extensive experience in natural language processing (NLP), statistical modeling, and deep learning. Mitch currently works as a senior applied researcher at GitHub, where he leads a team of machine learning scientists to develop new experiences and improve existing features within GitHub Copilot. Mitch is also an author of [_Applied Causal Inference_](https://appliedcausalinference.github.io/aci_book/), which released in August 2023.

Mitch lives in Chattanooga, TN. Outside of work, he enjoys rock climbing, hiking, music, and traveling.
